## Project Summary

CineTravel is a web application that helps users explore and visit real-world locations featured in popular movies.
The platform integrates movie location data with travel information, allowing users to find filming locations, learn about their significance, and plan trips accordingly. 
Users can search by movie, genre, actor, or country, and receive recommendations for travel itineraries based on their favorite films.
This project is used to bridge the gap between cinema and travel by providing an interactive way for movie lovers to explore destinations tied to their favorite films. 
The platform will use data from IMDB, TMDb, and travel APIs to offer a stable experience.
